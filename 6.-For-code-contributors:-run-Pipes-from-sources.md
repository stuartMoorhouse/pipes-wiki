# Prepare the environment

Prerequisites:
* [Gradle >= 4.6](https://gradle.org/install/)
* [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
* [quasar cli](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/installation)
* [java](https://jdk.java.net/13/)

# Environment setup
Run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/marklogic-community/pipes.git
cd pipes
npm install
npm install -g @quasar/cli
```

# Running from source
This process is meant for local development, i.e. changes are immediately reflected.

In one terminal/command prompt, run:
```
cd java-middle-tier
gradle runLocal
```

Then in a separate terminal/command prompt, run:
```
cd java-middle-tier
gradle runQuasarDev
```

# Build the jar
```
cd pipes/java-middle-tier
gradle bootJar
```

Resulting jar would be found at `java-middle-tier/build/libs/`
