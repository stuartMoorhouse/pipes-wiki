In this video, you'll learn how to use Pipes to:
* Create source blocks from the documents in the Staging (or any other!) Database
* Create blocks from the Entities as defined in your DHF project
* Transform the data from the source to target entity
* Live-preview your work
* Map / normalize values
* Create unique IDs
* Automatically convert dates to ISO format
* Create multiple entities on the output
* Add collections to the output documents
* Create URIs for output documents
* Add triples
* Save your work to the database (to continue work on it later)
* Export the custom code step to your DHF project and push the code directly to the database so it can be executed from DHF
