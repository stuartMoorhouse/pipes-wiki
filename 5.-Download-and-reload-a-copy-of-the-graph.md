## Download a graph
When you are satisfied with the graph you are building, you can download it to your machine. Just click the download icon in the menu bar:

![Download current graph](https://github.com/marklogic-community/pipes/blob/master/wikiAssets/download.png?raw=true)

You can then share the graph with some other users or just reload it back later.

## Upload a graph
To load a graph click the top left block icons in the main UI and drop the graph file in the dedicated area in the "From File" tab:

![Reload a saved graph](https://github.com/marklogic-community/pipes/blob/master/wikiAssets/upload.png?raw=true)

You are now ready to update and run the graph again.
